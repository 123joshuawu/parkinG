#	All defined output streams will have callbacks added to them
#
#	The name of the file will be the name used to reference that particular execution plan
#	
#	Each execution plan must have the input/output stream definitions in the very beginning
#		Input stream name MUST BE: inputStream
#		Output stream name(s) MUST contain: outputstream   -- not case-sensitive
#			- MUST HAVE AT LEAST ONE OUTPUT STREAM definition
